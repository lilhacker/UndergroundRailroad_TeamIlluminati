			Upon escaping from the plantations, make your way to nearby railway station. Maintain a low profile while travelling. These keywords will help you find friends to escape: 
			<li>Abolitionist — A person who believed in freedom for the slaves and demanded an end to slavery.</li>
			<li>Agent — A coordinator in the railroad who planned courses of escape and made contacts.</li>
			<li>Baggage — Fugitive slaves carried by the Underground Railroad workers.</li>
		</p>
			If you find traders or station masters saying the following phrases during or prior to travel, understand that they are friendly and transporting slaves to free states:
			<li>“The wind blows from the South today.” — A warning that slave hunters are nearby.</li>
<li>“ A friend with friends.” — A signal used to show the arrival of fugitives with an Underground Railroad conductor.</li>
<li>“A friend of a friend sent me.” — A code phrase fugitives use when traveling alone to show they were sent by the Underground Railroad.</li>

		<h3 style="font-family: arcade; font-size: 35px;">Stories of Escape And Change: Elizabeth Freeman</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 22px;">Elizabeth Freeman played a huge role in ending slavery in Massachusetts. Elizabeth Freeman, also known as Mum Bett, was born into slavery  the year 1774 in New York. Freeman like most slaves experienced severe punishments and received a large workload from her master, Colonel Ashley,since she was young. In 1780,<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> she attended a public event at a town square where she heard the new ratified Massachusetts State Constitution. Article 1 of the Constitution stated equality and freedom be granted to all. Freeman understood the meaning of Article 1 and realized that the oppression and inhumane treatment she was receiving as a slave went against it. So she went to Theodore Sedgwick, an abolitionist lawyer, with her case suing for her freedom. Sedgwick agreed to take up her case along with the case of her slavemaster’s other slave, Brom. In the case of Brom and Bett Vs. Ashley, the court ruled in the favor of Brom and Bett. Both Brom and Bett were given 30 shillings for their labor and were given freedom. Mum Bett renamed herself to Elizabeth Freeman after winning the case. Freeman’s courage to stand up for herself made her the first African-American woman to successfully file a lawsuit for freedom in Massachusetts. This case set an example for others to raise their voices and fight for their freedom and eventually led to slavery being abolished in Massachusetts.</span></p>
